        <h2>Notes:</h2>
    
        When I finished downloading the virtual machine, Kali did not want to boot, it simply gave me a black screen and a flashing cursor. To fix this I had to do a little research online but I finally got it. I started by making sure Virtualization was enabled on my Windows machine, then I reinstalled kali linux from the .iso file.
        
        Then I went into the command prompt using administrator privileges and entered the following:
        
        bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off
        
        Reboot your computer and try to boot Kali from the hypervisor. This is a common issue with lots of help online. Windows has its own hypervisor configuration that is enabled at bootup, but Virtual Box is in conflict with this so it is best to turn it off.
